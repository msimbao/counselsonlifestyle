							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Livestock and wild animals know what to do when
								physical sickness strikes. They have been observed eating certain plants. Seeking out a stream or lake, they
								will bathe in the water, or lay in it, to treat their injuries.</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A dog, bitten on the head by a rattlesnake, first
								killed the snake, then went to a nearby creek where he lay in the water off and on for a week. He recovered
								completely.</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Water is one of the most valuable helpers you have
								in the daily task of keeping yourself in health or in recovering health when it is lost.</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How very important it is that you drink enough water
								each day! Your kidneys alone filter about 50 gallons of fluid a day. In a 24-hour period, more than 8 quarts of
								digestive juices flow into the digestive tract. Much of this water is recycled over and over again by your
								kidneys. But about 2 to 4 quarts of water a day are lost through the urine, lungs, or perspiration. For this
								reason, if you do not keep drinking water, your kidneys cannot perform their function well, and kidney disease
								results.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It has been found that water intake can increase
								physical endurance and ability to work by as much as 80%. When you do not drink enough water, your blood
								thickens and flows with greater difficulty. This can cause trouble not only in your body tissues and organs, but
								also to your heart that must pump that sludged blood.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So many people eat far too much salt, sugar, and
								protein, yet each of these substances requires additional water to process.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In late 1986, the World Health Organization
								officially stated that the incidence of illness around the globe would fall by 80% if people in the developing
								nations had access to pure drinking water.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lack of water not only affects
								health; it affects work production as well. Athletes, in particular, find that a slight decrease in fluid will
								greatly affect performance.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is generally recommended that we drink 8 glasses
								of water a day. But it is best if you not drink it with your meals, but between them. The very best times for
								water drinking is first thing upon arising in the morning, and then 30 minutes or so before each meal. One or
								two warm glasses of water about a half hour before breakfast will help cleanse the stomach and sharpen the
								appetite. Small amounts drunk from time to time throughout the remainder of the day are also helpful.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But do not drink too much water. It will thin your
								blood too much and make you light-headed. If in doubt, keep in mind that there is less danger in drinking a
								little too much than in not drinking enough.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some people drink hot water or cold water drinks
								with their meal, but this hinders the digestion of the food even more than drinking lukewarm water at mealtime.
							</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The drinking water should be pure, but this is
								becoming more difficult to obtain. This is unfortunate. One solution is to purchase a reliable water distiller
								for your home. This will clean the water. Distilled water will not hurt you; only help you, if you are eating a
								good diet so that you are obtaining your proper amounts of calcium and other minerals from your food. In
								contrast, regular water often contains an excess of inorganic sodium, chlorine, sulfur, fluorine, iron,
								chromium, lead, and other undesirable minerals—and in far greater amounts than the body could possible use. We
								can be thankful that small, inexpensive home distillers are now easily available.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joseph M. Price, M.D., has done careful research
								into the relationship of chlorinated water to atherosclerosis in the arteries. He found so much evidence that he
								wrote a book about it, entitled, <i>Coronaries/Cholesterol/Chlorine</i>. For example, after seven months every
								chicken fed chlorinated water had developed atherosclerosis, while no chickens fed pure water had it. Here is
								another interesting fact: American soldiers killed in the Korean War averaged 75% with evidence of coronary
								atherosclerosis, yet had an average age of only 22! In order to avoid disease, the water given the soldiers in
								Korea had been very heavily chlorinated.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cadmium in water increases high blood pressure. Dr.
								Henry Schroeder has established that people who die of high blood pressure complications tend to have an
								unusually high level of cadmium in their kidneys. And this most frequently occurs in certain cities with higher
								cadmium content in the drinking water.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lead, copper, and sulfur can also be dangerous. Zinc
								in the water helps to protect the body against cadmium and copper. Patients with either hypertension or
								atherosclerotic heart disease or an old myocardial infraction generally have higher copper and lower zinc levels
								in the serum and toenail samples, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you have the choice, when
								drinking water from pipes, it is better to drink hard water than soft water. The hard water, which mainly has
								calcium and magnesium in it, will lower your chances of acquiring cardiovascular and kidney diseases. The
								&quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; for October 7, 1974, reported on Monroe County, Florida,
								where, by changing its source, the hardness of the drinking water was dramatically increased from 0.5 ppm to 200
								ppm. &quot;The death rates from cardiovascular disease dropped from a range of 500 to 700 to a range of 200 to
								300 only four years after the increase in water hardness.&quot;</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oddly enough, you can purchase water-softening
								equipment and supplies,—but no one sells anything to artificially harden it. Hard water results primarily from
								the presence of calcium and magnesium salts in the water, while softness is due to the absence of these salts.
								These two minerals help protect the water from absorbing dangerous minerals from the ground—or from pipes.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The average person will, by the age of 75, have
								drunk 20,000 gallons of water. Stop and think about it for a moment—and you will agree with the statement of
								scientists that this is the &quot;water planet.&quot; Not only is six tenths of its surface covered by water,
								but water is the essential factor that makes all life possible. No plant, animal, or living organism can survive
								long without it.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;When we come to the individual need for
								water, it is readily realized that water is certainly our most precious mineral. It is the most essential of all
								minerals for our bodies. An animal can lose all its fat, about half its protein,—but if it loses as much as
								one-tenth of its water, it will die.&quot;—<i>Jonathan Forman, M.D., in &quot;Water and Man.&quot;</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your body is 60% water. The countless millions of
								cells inside of you are constantly being bathed in water. And this is not merely a soaking process, but a
								rewashing activity done by your blood stream. Water in the blood brings nutrition and oxygen to your tissues,
								and carries off wastes. If injury occurs, coagulants come out of the fluid and stop the bleeding, while white
								blood cells emerge from the blood stream and begin attacking poisonous substances. Delicate chemical balances
								are maintained by the flowing blood, as hormones, digestive substances, and many other vital substances are
								transported through the body fluids to their appointed place.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is no wonder that this most precious commodity
								should be needed by mankind—not only inside but outside as well.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frequent bathing is a very important health
								practice. It should be done at least once a week, but a daily bath or shower is even better. Warm baths relax;
								hot baths prepare for cold ones and strengthen and invigorate; all baths help cleanse the skin. There are
								millions of tiny pores—little mouths—that open out onto your skin. Bathing cleans them and removes the
								impurities that they bring to the surface.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But, in all your consideration of the values of
								water, do keep in mind that a better use of water must be accompanied by corresponding improvements in the diet
								also.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Rest, freedom from care,
								light, pure air, pure water, and spare diet, are all that they need to make them well.&quot;—<i>2 Selected

							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HYDROTHERAPY</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Now let us turn our attention to
								one of the marvelous uses of water: hydrotherapy. In our book, <i>The Water Therapy Manual </i><a
									href="http://www.pathlights.com/catalog/storedoor.htm"
									style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;"
									target="_blank">(see </a><span class="s23">order sheet</span>), we present the various principles involved
								in giving simple water treatments to the sick. But, just now, let us summarize some of what is included in this
								science of water therapy:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hydrotherapy has been used for thousands of years,
								for it is generally available, so dramatically helps many sicknesses, and is easy to apply. In 1747, John
								Wesley, the founder of Methodism, wrote a textbook on hydrotherapy. Vincent Priessnitz, a Silesian peasant, was
								the first to organize these simple folk remedies into a science. He successfully treated so many people with hot
								and cold water that he became well-known throughout Europe. Unfortunately, he wrote nothing. The first modern
								water therapy textbook originated in Bavaria in 1886. Like Priessnitz, Sebastian Kneipp had been frail as a
								child and youth, and attained unusual physical stamina through the use of water therapy. When he began treating
								the sick, thousands flocked to him from all over the continent. His classic book on the subject, <i>My Water
									Cure. </i>Kneipp&#39;s hope was that his book would help people throughout the world. And it did.</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The English edition alone underwent fifty printings
								in its first ten years.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Water-cure establishments, or &quot;hydros,&quot;
								sprang up all over Germany and Europe, later spreading to the United States. In the late 1800s, Dr. J.
								Winternitz, of Vienna, discovered that hydrotherapy worked because of its direct and indirect effects on the
								nervous system. The temperature of the water, the percussion of the water, and the body part receiving it
								determined how it would help the body. By 1906, Dr. John H. Kellogg, in the United States, has written his
								mammoth &quot;Rational Hydrotherapy,&quot; the first scientific text on this subject, and for depth of coverage
								has not been surpassed to this day.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here is a brief description of what some of these
								simple water treatments are like. There would not, of course, be room in this brief tract to explain how to give
								them all. But we will include some excerpts from our full-length book, <a
									href="http://www.pathlights.com/catalog/storedoor.htm"

									target="_blank">The Water Therapy Manual (see </a><span class="s19">order sheet</span><i>).</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LOCAL BATHS<span class="p">—Hot, cold, or alternate
									hot and cold water may be applied to most any part of the body to produce desired effects. The alternate hot
									and cold bath is one of the most frequently used.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Simply fill two containers larger than the part to
								be treated, and fill with hot and cold water. Then immerse the body part in hot, then cold water. The usual
								interval is 3 minutes in the hot and then 1 minute in the cold; repeat this three times, ending with cold.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SITZ BATHS<span class="p">—This is the
									&quot;sitting bath,&quot; and is very helpful for problems of the lower abdomen or pelvic region, including
									menstrual disorder, diseases of the uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes, prostatitis, constipation, and
									digestive disorders. There are several kinds of Sitz Baths and, when needed suddenly, they can be
									invaluable. Two large galvanized or plastic tubs are used in giving them. For maximum</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">benefit, these baths must be done
								several times a day, depending on the person&#39;s condition. The effect is to increase the circulation of blood
								and lymph to the pelvic region, remove internal congestion, and improve tissue vitality and nutrition.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE WET SHEET PACKS<span class="p">—The Wet Sheet
									Pack is used with many acute diseases, especially conditions with fever or due to toxemia. As a result of
									the pack, if continued 3 hours or all night, the fever will have been aided in its work by increased
									elimination and thus be lowered due to decreased need, by the body, for the fever. Do not reuse the sheet
									used for a prolonged Wet Sheet Pack without first washing it, since it contains many toxins.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FOMENTATIONS<span class="p">—Where prolonged heat
									is needed, the pack is replenished frequently, as with continuous cold compresses. The duration of the
									Fomentation depends on the temperature of this hot compress and the effect desired. The effect of local heat
									stops pain, draws healing blood, and helps induce sound, restful sleep. This application of moist heat to
									the body is excellent for chest congestion due to colds, bronchitis, or pleurisy.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ENEMAS<span class="p">—This old-fashioned home
									treatment has proven to be a great help to many people over the years. Waste matter is primarily eliminated
									from the body through the bowel, bladder, skin, and lungs. A person who is sick has more wastes than normal
									to expel, and an Enema or colonic is very helpful in eliminating them.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are two sample water treatments. They are
								quoted from the author&#39;s book, <a href="http://www.pathlights.com/catalog/storedoor.htm"

							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COLD COMPRESS</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WHAT IT IS<span class="p">—A Cold Compress is a
									local application of cold given by means of a cloth wrung out of cold water. Either hand towels or cotton
									cloths may be used.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HOW IT CAN HELP YOU<span class="p">—The Cold
									Compress is very helpful in cases of fever, pain due to edema or trauma (such as sprains). And they are used
									for congestion in the sinuses and for congestive headaches (for both of these, use a Cold Compress along
									with a Hot Foot Bath). In addition, they are helpful for tachycardia (heartbeat over a 100 per
									minute).</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HOW TO APPLY IT<span class="p">—</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1—Use Turkish towels to protect the
								bedding, as well as his clothing, from becoming wet.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2—Fold the towels (or cloth) to a
								desired size, then dip into cold water and wring them out—but only enough to prevent dripping. (Better: Take the
								wet cloths off a block of ice and quickly apply them. In this way the compresses will be far colder.)</p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3—Lay them on the
								afflicted part.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4—Change the compress for a fresh cold
								one every 1-5 minutes. A set of two compresses will be needed so they can be continually alternated. If this is
								not done, the compress quickly warms up. The thicker the compress, the less often will it have to be changed for
								a new one.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5—Cold compresses can be placed on the
								head, neck, over the heart or lungs, and to the abdomen, spine, etc. When applied to the head, they need to be
								pressed down firmly—especially over the forehead and temporal arteries (these arteries are to the right and left
								of the forehead, just above and to the front of the ears). The compresses can be placed over the abdomen in
								typhoid fever.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ADDITIONAL POINTS<span class="p">—Unless the
									application is quite thick, and always when it is left on too long (over 3-5 minutes), the application
									changes from a cold compress to a heating compress. And when you are applying a Cold Compress, you do not
									want it to turn into a Heating Compress!</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WHAT IT IS<span class="p">—These are applications
									of cold cloths, covered with flannel, to a body area. The body reacts and heats up the pack and the result
									is improved circulation and a better flow of healing blood in and out of the afflicted area.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -40pt;text-align: left;">HEATING THROAT COMPRESS AND</h4>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DRY THROAT COMPRESS</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WHAT IT IS<span class="p">—This is a cold compress
									that is so covered up that warming soon takes place. The effect produced is that of a mild, prolonged
									application of moist heat.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HOW IT CAN HELP YOU<span class="p">—Gradually, over
									several hours, a throat compress can reduce inflammation and bring healing to a body part. A cold, wet cloth
									is placed about the throat, then covered with dry flannel to prevent air circulation, thus increasing body
									heat in that area. Mothers will often place a heating compress on a child with a sore throat in the evening
									and take it off the next morning.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The compress should be dry by then.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PROBLEMS IT CAN HELP SOLVE<span class="p">—The
									Throat Compress is a very common household remedy for sore throat, hoarseness, tonsillitis, pharyngitis,
									laryngitis, quinsy, and eustachian tube inflammation.</span></h4>

									thicknesses or ordinary cotton cloth about 3 inches wide and long enough to encircle the neck twice. Two
									thicknesses of flannel not less than 4 inches wide. Safety pins. Possibly a piece of bandage.</span></h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HOW TO APPLY IT<span class="p">—</span></h4>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1—Prepare your
								materials for the neck compress. If it is to go on one who is too frail to warm up, then use a Dry Throat
								Compress, which is prepared in the same manner as the regular Heating Throat Compress, but without first
								wringing the cold water from it.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2—In giving a regular Heating Throat
								Compress, wring cold water from the cotton cloth, and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3
								thicknesses about the neck.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3—Cover it well with the flannel
								(single or double thickness, depending on the weight of the material). Fit the flannel snugly, but not too
								tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4—In tonsillitis, quinsy, and
								inflammation of the eustachian tube, the compress should extend upward about the lower part of the ear. You may
								need to hold up this part of the compress (that is by the lower part of the ear) with a bandage that is fastened
								to it and goes over the top part of the head and back down to it on the other side.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5—Remove it the next morning. It should
								be entirely dry. When first put on, it can be quite wet but should not drip. But the next morning it must be
								dry.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6—As soon as you have removed the
								compress, rub the neck with a cloth wrung out of cold water.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In health and in sickness, pure water is one
								of heaven&#39;s choicest blessings. Its proper use promotes health. It is the beverage which God provided to
								quench the thirst of animals and man. Drunk freely, it helps to supply the necessities of the system, and
								assists nature to resist disease. The external application of water is one of the easiest and most satisfactory
								ways of regulating the circulation of the blood. A cold or cool bath is an excellent tonic. Warm baths open the
								pores, and thus aid in the elimination of impurities. Both warm and neutral baths soothe the nerves and equalize
								the circulation.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But many have never learned by experience the
								beneficial effects of the proper use of water, and they are afraid of it. Water treatments are not appreciated
								as they should be, and to apply them skillfully requires work that many are unwilling to perform. But none
								should feel excused for ignorance or indifference on this subject. There are many ways in which water can be
								applied to relieve pain and check disease. All should become intelligent in its use in simple home treatments.
								Mothers, especially, should know how to care for their families in both health and sickness.&quot;—<i>Ministry
									of Healing, p. 237.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Taken with meals, water diminishes the flow
								of the salivary glands; and the colder the</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">water, the greater the injury to
								the stomach. Ice water or iced lemonade, drunk with meals, will arrest digestion until the system has imparted
								sufficient warmth to the stomach to enable it to take up its work again.&quot;—<i>Review, July 29, 1884.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Food should not be washed down; no drink is
								needed with meals. Eat slowly, and allow the saliva to mingle with the food. The more liquid there is taken into
								the stomach with the meals, the more difficult it is for the food to digest; for the liquid must be first
								absorbed . . Hot drinks are debilitating; and besides, those who indulge in their use become slaves to the habit
								. . Do not eat largely of salt; give up bottled pickles; keep fiery spiced food out of your stomach; eat fruit
								with your meals, and the irritation which calls for so much drink will cease to exist. But if anything is needed
								to quench thirst, pure water, drunk some little time before or after a meal, is all that nature requires . .
								Water is the best liquid possible to cleanse the tissues.&quot;—<i>Review, July 29, 1884.</i></p>

							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Frequent bathing is very beneficial,
								especially at night just before retiring, or upon rising in the morning.&quot;—<i>Healthful Living, p. 192.</i>
							</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Bathing frees the skin from the accumulation
								of impurities which are constantly collecting, and keeps the skin moist and supple, thereby increasing and
								equalizing the circulation.&quot;—<i>Healthful Living, p. 789.</i></p>

								followed by friction till their bodies are aglow.&quot;—<i>Counsels on Health, p. 103.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Persons in health should on no account
								neglect bathing. They should by all means bathe as often as twice a week. Those who are not in health have
								impurities in the blood, and the skin is not in a healthy condition. The multitude of pores, or little mouths,
								through which the body breathes, become clogged and filled with waste matter. The skin needs to be carefully and
								thoroughly cleansed, that the pores may do their work in freeing the body</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">from impurities; therefore feeble
								persons who are diseased surely need the advantages and blessings of bathing as often as twice a week, and
								frequently even more than this is positively necessary. Whether a person is sick or well, respiration is more
								free and easy if bathing is practiced. By it, the muscles become more flexible, the mind and body are alike
								invigorated, the intellect is made brighter, and every faculty becomes livelier. The bath is a soother of the
								nerves. It promotes general perspiration, quickens the circulation, overcomes obstructions in the system, and
								acts beneficially on the kidneys and urinary organs. Bathing helps the bowels, stomach, and liver, giving energy
								and new life to each. It also promotes digestion, and instead of the system being weakened it is strengthened.
							</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead of increasing the liability to cold, a
								bath, properly taken, fortifies against cold because the circulation is improved, and the uterine organs, which
								are more or less congested, are relieved; for the blood is brought to the surface, and a more easy and regular
								flow of the blood through all the blood vessels is obtained.&quot;—<i>3 Testimonies, pp. 70-71.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If the garments worn are not frequently
								cleansed from impurities, the pores of the skin absorb again the waste matter thrown off. The impurities of the
								body, if not allowed to escape, are taken back into the blood and forced upon the internal organs. Nature, to
								relieve herself of poisonous impurities, makes an effort to free the system, which effort produces fevers and
								what is termed disease.&quot;—<i>Healthful Living, p. 206.</i></p>

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Water can be used in many ways to relieve
								suffering. Drafts of clear, hot water taken before eating (half a quart, more or less), will never do any harm,
								but will rather be productive of good. A cup of tea made from catnip herb will quiet the nerves. Hop tea will
								induce sleep. Hop poultices over the stomach will relieve pain. If the eyes are weak, if there is pain in the
								eyes, or inflammation, soft flannel cloths wet in hot water and salt, will bring relief quickly. When the head
								is congested, if the feet and limbs are put in a bath with a little mustard, relief will be obtained. There are

							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not only our bodies need washing, our souls need it
								as well. We are to be washed by the Word, as we daily study in the Bible. It brings cleansing and strength.
								&quot;He sent His Word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.&quot; (Psalm 107:20).
								&quot;Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.&quot; (Colossians 3:16).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
								precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that
								is in the world through lust.&quot; (2 Peter 1:4).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is cleansing power in studying Scripture. By
								doing it daily, we receive an ongoing washing through the Word. &quot;Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his
								way? by taking heed thereto according to Thy Word.&quot; (Psalm 119:9). &quot;Now are ye clean through the word
								which I have spoken unto</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you.&quot; (John 15:3).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This occurs as we pray for help, learn anew His
								Word,—and bring it into our souls by living it out in our lives each day. &quot;Thy Word have I hid in mine
								heart, that I might not sin against Thee.&quot; (Psalm 119:11). &quot;By the words of Thy lips, I have kept me
								from the paths of the destroyer.&quot; (Psalm 17:4).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While Jesus was here on earth, He also gave us
								another example—if we would follow in His steps:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto
								John, to be baptized of him.&quot; (Matthew 3:13). He was baptized by John the Baptist, not because He had
								sinned, but as an example to us. The Father was pleased with what He had done (Matthew 3:17).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then Jesus later commanded His
								disciples to baptize converts from all nations. &quot;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
								the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ghost.&quot; (Matthew 28:19).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is a command of Jesus which we are to follow,
								after learning God&#39;s special truths in Scripture and dedicating our lives to Him.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
								be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&quot; (John 3:5).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">John was baptized at Aenon, &quot;because there was
								much water there&quot; (John 3:23). Jesus, our example, &quot;went up straightway out of the water&quot;
								(Matthew 3:16). It is obvious that this was baptism by immersion, not merely sprinkling. Had John used
								sprinkling, one pail of water would have sufficed for a great host of people. Philip and the eunuch also went
								into, and came out of, the water (Acts 8:36-39).</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Philip had immersed the man in a pool of water by
								the side of the road.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The very word, &quot;baptize&quot; comes from the
								Greek word, &quot;baptizo,&quot; which means &quot;dip under,&quot; &quot;immerse,&quot; or &quot;plunge
								under.&quot; The meaning is definitely not &quot;sprinkle&quot; or &quot;pour.&quot;</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is clear, from the Bible, that baptism represents
								a complete death to the old way of life, a burial with Christ, and a rising with Him out of death into a new
								life. The &quot;old man of sin&quot; is dead and, rising, we become a &quot;new creature&quot; in Christ. This
								is the meaning of baptism—which obviously must be by immersion. Read this carefully:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Know ye not, that so many of us as were
								baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death:
								that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
								newness of life.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;For if we have been planted together in the
								likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is
								crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.&quot;
								(Romans 6:3-6).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in
								memory what I preached unto you . . how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He
								was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:2-4).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye
								are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead.&quot;
								(Colossians 2:12).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before baptism, the candidate must be carefully
								taught (Matthew 28:19-20); he must believe (Mark 16:16); he must repent of his sins (Acts 2:38); he must be
								willing to die to sin (Romans 67:3, 11-13); He</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">must be ready to live for God
								(Romans 6:11, 13).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to baptism, there is another water
								service that we are to perform: the ordinance of foot washing, in connection with the Lord&#39;s Supper.
								God&#39;s plan is for us to keep, in memory, Christ&#39;s death and resurrection, and our baptism into it.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some think that Sunday must be kept holy in
								commemoration of Christ&#39;s resurrection. but, according to Scripture (1 Corinthians 15:2-4, quoted above),
								the ordinance which commemorates Christ&#39;s resurrection is Baptism. In addition to baptism, the Lord&#39;s
								Supper commemorates Christ&#39;s death.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;The Lord Jesus the same night in which He
								was betrayed took bread: and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is My body, which
								is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me.&quot; (1 Corinthians 11:23-24).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;For as often as ye eat this bread, and
								drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord&#39;s death till He come.&quot; (1 Corinthians 11:26).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If we walk in the light, as He is in the
								light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all
								sin.&quot; (1 John 1:7). &quot;And truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.&quot;
								(1 John 1:3).</p>
