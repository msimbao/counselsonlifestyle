    <h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be &quot;abstemious&quot; is to be moderate or
        sparing in the use of certain things, including an excess of even good food. Temperance has a similar meaning:
        It means to have moderation or self-restraint.</h4>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p class="s12" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Temperance can also mean to totally
        avoid certain substances or activities, and so does abstinence.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are here speaking of self-control. In order to
        succeed physically, mentally, and morally in life, we must have temperance in regard to things good and
        abstinence in regard to things harmful.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;In order to preserve health, temperance in
        all things is necessary,—temperance in labor, temperance in eating and drinking.&quot;<i>—How to Live, p.
            57.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;True temperance teaches us to abstain
        entirely from that which is injurious, and to use judiciously only healthful and nutritious articles of
        food.&quot;<i>—Health Reformer, April 1, 1877.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The evangelist, Paul, counsels us to be
        &quot;temperate in all things&quot; (1 Corinthians 9:25). This means that we should shun that which is harmful,
        avoid unneeded extremes, and be moderate in the enjoyment of those things which are lawful. Health of body,
        mind, and soul is impossible without careful, temperate living.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even when eating the most careful diet, you can get
        too much of a good thing. Too much, even of the best food, is harmful. Too much sunshine can result in severe
        sunburn; too much exercise can cause excessive exhaustion. The Apostle Paul said, &quot;Let your moderation be
        known unto all men&quot; (Philippians 4:5). Seneca said, &quot;Man does not die; he kills himself!&quot; Much of
        the tragic shortening of men&#39;s lives—that we so often see around us—is unnecessary. Men and women violate
        the laws of health, and the law of abstemiousness is one of the most important of these laws.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The well-known American writer,
        William Cullen Bryant, lived to a very old age. When asked the reason for his excellent health at such an
        advanced age, he replied, &quot;It is all summed up in one word: moderation.&quot; If we would be temperate in
        all things, self-control must be exercised in our conversation, in our daily diet, in our work habits, in our
        recreation, in our travels, in our time for sleep, and in our study. Throughout life, we must ever be on guard
        lest we fall into intemperance. The strains and injuries of earlier years add up and reveal themselves in the
        later years. Live carefully, and if you are not doing so,—then immediately turn about and determine that, by the
        help of God, you will live a better life.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fortunately, whenever we begin living more
        healthfully, our future happiness immediately begins improving.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The will power to make the needed changes can be
        found only in Christ, humble submission to Him, and careful obedience to His Inspired Word. It is the will of
        our heavenly Father that we not only learn and obey His Moral Law, the Ten Commandments, but that we also learn
        and obey the physical laws that govern our being.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A little later in this chapter will be found a
        number of very helpful quotations that will explain the importance of studying and living by the laws of health.
        Moderation is something that but few value as they should. Yet it is the cord that binds together many other
        health principles.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Bible says, &quot;Every man that striveth for
        the mastery is temperate in all things.&quot; (1 Corinthians 9:25). As we have mentioned earlier, true
        temperance includes moderation in things good as well as abstinence in things harmful.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are some of the harmful things that should be
        avoided: Do not use tobacco in any form, for it is a slow but powerful poison. Totally avoid alcoholic drinks.
        Stay away from poisonous substances and toxic drugs. This includes not only liquids and solids, but also vapors
        and fumes. Beware of addicting substances and never indulge in them. Included under this category would be not
        only alcoholic beverages, but also caffeine products, such as coffee, tea, and cola drinks. Caffeine products
        injure your organs and; in addition, cola drinks gradually melt your teeth.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The heavily sugared foods, such as candy, ice
        cream, cake, and chewing gum are better left alone.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Bible says not to eat the blood or the fat,
        yet it is practically impossible to prepare meat dishes with any taste—after all the blood, fat, and uric acid
        (urine in the tissues) has been first soaked and boiled out of the raw meat.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do not use greasy foods. This includes butter,
        margarine, and animal fat. Any oil that is solid or semi- solid at room temperature should never be put into the
        body. Beware of trans-fats. These are the partially hydrogenated oils that have been put into margarine and many
        other foods. An example of this is the peanut butter sold in regular grocery stores. You will notice that it
        contains no free-flowing (&quot;runny&quot;) oil. All of the oil has been solidified by hydrogenation into a
        grease form.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemically, such grease has the
        same effect in the body that animal fat has. (In addition, some manufacturers remove the expensive peanut oil
        from the crushed peanuts, and then add to the peanut pulp a cheap oil that has been hydrogenated into grease.
        This cheap oil additive is sometimes an animal fat, although marked on the label as &quot;vegetable oil.&quot;)
        Meat in the diet has a tendency to rot in the system. This is due to the fact that our digestive tracts are much
        longer than those of dogs, tigers, and other flesh- eating animals.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do not cook or eat food in aluminum. Aluminum salts
        are poisonous to the body. Avoid foods that have been taken apart, such as white flour, white rice, white sugar,
        white bread, etc. Instead eat the whole foods: whole-grain bread and cereal, brown rice, honey, etc.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Baking powder and soda should not be used in food
        preparation, for they damage the delicate lining of the stomach. Vinegar is a powerful acid and should never be
        in any food that you eat.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The use of spices and condiments disturbs the
        stomach, creates a thirst that is difficult to satisfy with food, can lead to addictive habits, and has been
        known to cause disease. For example, white and black pepper can lead to intestinal cancer.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avoid automobile and tobacco fumes. Car exhaust
        contains lead, and cigarette smoke has many dangerous chemicals, in addition to nicotine. Stay away from spray
        painters. Metal lacquer (such as is used by auto body refinishers) is especially harmful to the lungs.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chlorinated water leads to atherosclerosis, and
        fluoridated water injures your bones, teeth, and nerves.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do not eat or drink things that are too hot or too
        cold. Both upset the stomach and weaken the digestive system.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Food preservatives and insecticide residues are
        both dangerous in food. It is best to wash fresh fruit and vegetables before eating them, in order to eliminate
        as much of the insecticide as possible. Try to avoid using processed foods that list preservatives on the label.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both chocolate and cocoa contain harmful substances.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That which is harmful should be avoided, and many of
        those things which are good should be used in moderation: Maintain a balance of rest and exercise; not too much
        work or too little. Regularity in scheduling and the daily routines of life will greatly aid in keeping you in
        the best health. Try to have a set time for rising, morning worship, prayer, drinking your water, mealtime,
        quitting time in the afternoon, family worship, evening walk time, bedtime, etc. Maintaining simple routines
        simplifies life, relaxes the mind, and helps us work more efficiently.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Personal cleanliness is actually another type of
        moderation.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cleanliness of body, clothing,
        bedding, and house are important to good health. Open the windows and let in the purifying sunlight and fresh
        air. Water is the best cleansing agent known to mankind. It is a gift of God. Keep your environment clean and
        your life will be a happier one.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Closely related to cleanliness is neatness and
        tidiness. Keeping things neat and in order is both encouraging to the spirits and helpful to mental efficiency.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tight compressions about the waist, such as belts,
        corset, etc., can induce later pelvic organ disease. Suspend the clothing from the shoulders. Wear clothing that
        will avoid chilling of the arms and legs.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Refuse to live a life of anxious concern. Worry
        wears out the life forces. If you cannot solve it in five minutes, give it to God in prayer—and then forget it.
        Later the solutions will come to mind. That simple habit has been a help to this writer.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Have certain times to work and certain times not to;
        do the same with your mind. Turn it off at times and just relax. Above all things, keep cheerful, and keep close
        to God and His Written Word. Permit nothing to keep you continually depressed or anxious. People that are
        cheerful and relaxed always are healthier and have longer, happier lives than they otherwise would—without
        exception.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A cheerful, relaxed, unworried attitude; trust in
        God; prayerful and obedient study of His Scriptures; moderation in living habits; the use of the eight natural
        remedies; the avoidance of addictive and poisonous substances; trying to be a blessing and a help to those
        around you (regardless of whether they seem to appreciate your efforts);—this is the seven-fold formula for a
        happy, satisfying, worthwhile, and long life.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES</h4>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;God is the owner of the whole man. Soul,
        body, and spirit are His. God gave His only begotten Son for the body as well as the soul, and our entire life
        belongs to God, to be consecrated to His service, that through the exercise of every faculty He has given, we
        may glorify Him.&quot;—<i>Healthful Living, p. 9.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The living organism is God&#39;s property. It
        belongs to Him by creation and by redemption; and by a misuse of any of our powers we rob God of the honor due
        Him.&quot;—<i>Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 16.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The wonderful mechanism of the human body
        does not receive half the care that is often given to a mere lifeless machine.&quot;—<i>Gospel Workers, p.
            175.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The health should be as sacredly guarded as
        the character.&quot;—<i>Counsels to Parents, Teachers and Students, p. 84.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Our very bodies are not our
        own, to treat as we please, to cripple by habits that lead to decay, making it impossible to render to God
        perfect service. Our lives and all our faculties belong to Him. He is caring for us every moment; He keeps the
        living machinery in action; if we were left to run it for one moment, we should die. We are absolutely dependent
        upon God.&quot;—<i>Medical Ministry, p. 13.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It is our duty to study the laws that govern
        our being, and conform to them. Ignorance in these things is sin.&quot;—<i>Healthful Living, p. 13.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;From the first dawn of reason, the human mind
        should become intelligent in regard to the physical structure. We may behold and admire the work of God in the
        natural world, but the human habitation is the most wonderful.&quot;—<i>Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and
            Students, p. 125.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Ignorance of physiology and neglect to
        observe the laws of health have brought many to the grave who might have lived to labor and study
        intelligently.&quot;—<i>Special Testimonies on Education, p. 98.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;To become acquainted with the wonderful human
        organism,—the bones, muscles, stomach, liver, bowels, heart, and pores of the skin,—and to understand the
        dependence of one organ upon another for the healthful action of all, is a study in which most mothers take no
        interest.&quot;—<i>3 Testimonies, p. 136.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Study that marvelous organism, the human
        system, and the laws by which it is governed.&quot;—<i>Christian Temperance, p. 120.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If people would reason from cause to effect,
        and would follow the light which shines upon them, they would pursue a course which would insure health, and the
        mortality would be far less . . All who possess common capabilities should understand the wants of their own
        system.&quot;—<i>How to Live, p. 51.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;He who hungers and thirsts after God will
        seek for an understanding of the laws which the God of wisdom has impressed upon creation. These laws are a
        transcript of His character. They must control all who enter the heavenly and better
        country.&quot;—<i>Unpublished Testimonies, August 30, 1896.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;God&#39;s law is written by His own finger
        upon every nerve, every muscle, every faculty which has been entrusted to man.&quot;—<i>Unpublished Testimonies,
            August 30, 1896.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The transgression of physical law is
        transgression of God&#39;s law.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Our Creator is Jesus Christ. He is the author
        of our being. He is the author of the physical</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">law as He is the author of the
        Moral Law. And the human being who is careless and reckless of the habits and practices that concern his
        physical life and health, sins against God. God is not reverenced, respected or recognized.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is shown by the injury done to the body
        in violation of physical law.&quot;—<i>Unpublished Testimonies, May 19, 1897.</i></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;God loves His creatures with a love that
        is both tender and strong. He has established the laws of nature; but His laws are not arbitrary exactions.
        Every `Thou shalt not,&#39; whether in physical or Moral Law, contains or implies a promise. If it is obeyed,
        blessings will attend your steps; if it is disobeyed, the result is danger and unhappiness.&quot;—<i>5

        draught upon the nervous energy . . Therefore, when the mind or body is taxed heavily after eating, the process
        of digestion is hindered. The vitality of the system, which is needed to carry on the work in one direction, is
        called away and set to work in another.&quot;—<i>2 Testimonies, p. 413.</i></p>

        and wrong habits of eating, dressing, or sleeping affect the brain, and prevent the attaining of that which the

    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It is impossible for the brain to do its best
        work when the digestive powers are abused. Many eat hurriedly of various kinds of food, which set up a war in
        the stomach, and thus confuse the brain . . At mealtime cast off care and taxing thought. Do not be hurried, but
        eat slowly and with cheerfulness, your heart filled with gratitude to God for all His blessings. And do not
        engage in brain labor immediately after a meal. Exercise moderately, and give a little time for the stomach to
        begin its work.&quot;—<i>Gospel Workers,</i></p>

    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is the governing power in the nature of
        man,—the power of decision, of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will. Desires for goodness
        and purity are right, so far as they go; but if we stop here, they avail nothing. Many will go down to ruin
        while hoping and desiring to overcome their evil propensities. They do not yield the will</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to God. They do not <i>choose
        </i>to serve Him.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;God has given us the power of choice; it is
        ours to exercise. We can not change our hearts, we can not control our thoughts, our impulses, our affections.
        We can not make ourselves pure, fit for God&#39;s service. But we can <i>choose </i>to serve and do according to
        His good pleasure. Thus our whole nature will be brought under the control of Christ . . A pure and noble life
        of victory over appetite and lust, is possible to every one who will unite his weak, wavering human will to the
        omnipotent, unwavering will of God.&quot;—<i>Ministry of Healing, p. 176.</i></p>

    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Abstemiousness, or temperance, is simple
        self-control. Only through the continual aid of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ can we be empowered, by His
        grace, to control ourselves, resist temptation, and obey God&#39;s will.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The will of God is revealed throughout the Inspired
        Writings of Scripture, and especially in the Ten Commandments which summarize many basic principles of
        godliness.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you would be like Jesus, then, by His enabling
        grace, obey the Ten Commandments which He gave on Mount Sinai over 3,400 years ago.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Obedience to God is the basis of all true
        temperance, the foundation of successful, happy living in this life, and the assurance of life on through
        eternity with God.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting
        the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right,
        rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.&quot; (Psalm 19:7-8).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is in the law that we learn God&#39;s pattern for
        our conduct and His will for our lives. &quot;And knowest His will . . being instructed out of the law.&quot;
        (Romans 2:18). &quot;Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring
        every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.&quot;
        (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intemperance in life is sin, and sin is the breaking
        of God&#39;s law. &quot;Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the
        law.&quot; (1 John 3:4). &quot;For by the law is the knowledge of sin.&quot; (Romans 3:20).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Obedience to God is the passport to heaven. Jesus
        said, &quot;If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&quot; (Matthew 19:17). &quot;Blessed are the
        undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.&quot; (Psalm 119:1). &quot;Moreover by them is Thy
        servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.&quot; (Psalm 19:11).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rewards of obedience are
        abundant: &quot;Great peace have they which love Thy law: and nothing shall offend them.&quot; (Psalm 119:165).
        &quot;O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! Then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness
        as the waves of the sea.&quot; (Isaiah 48:18). &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good
        understanding have all they that do His</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">commandments.&quot; (Psalm 111:10). &quot;If ye be
        willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.&quot; (Isaiah 1:19).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet it is only through the enabling strength of
        Christ&#39;s grace that we can keep God&#39;s law. Apart from Christ, we are helpless to resist sin.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for
        it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.&quot; (Romans 1:16). Jesus came to earth and
        died so we might be delivered from falling into sin. &quot;Thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His
        people from their sins.&quot; (Matthew 1:21). &quot;We preach . . Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of
        God.&quot; (1 Corinthians 1:23-24). &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&quot;
        (John 1:29).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By believing in Christ as our Saviour, and acting in
        accordance with our faith, we are enabled to obey all that God asks of us. &quot;Do we then make void the law
        through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.&quot; (Romans 3:31).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is the basis of the new covenant: God enables
        us to obey His commandments as we accept and cling to Jesus, His Son. Christ is our Mediator in Heaven, and He
        strengthens us to resist temptation and obey God&#39;s law. (Hebrews 8:6, 10).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Law and grace are closely associated in the plan of
        redemption. To understand grace, we need to understand the law.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the beginning, God created man and placed him
        under law. Man was not just to be a wild man, a law unto himself. He was to obey God. The Moral Law of the Ten
        Commandments were later written down (Exodus 20). Other laws were also given at that time.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There were civil laws which regulated many matters
        of the nation of Israel. They applied to the governing of the nation.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then there were the ceremonial, or sanctuary, laws.
        These governed the religious services of the nation, and were written in a book which was placed beside the Ark
        of the Covenant. These ceremonial laws were abolished at the cross, for at that time Christ, the great
        antitypical Lamb of God died for mankind. No longer need lambs be brought to the earthly sanctuary to be
        sacrificed. In Christ at Calvary, shadow met substance and type met antitype—and the ceremonial laws were
        abolished.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Blotting out the handwriting
        of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His
        cross.&quot; (Colossians 2:14). &quot;Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.&quot;
        (Colossians 2:17).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then, third, there was the Ten Commandments. It is
        the Moral Law of God, given by Him to all humanity. It is the universal law of mankind. No one is to commit
        adultery, or the other sins listed in this holy code.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This was the only law written by the finger of God.
        It was the only law placed inside the Ark of the Covenant. &quot;He wrote on the tables, according to the first
        writing, the Ten Commandants, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day
        of the assembly&quot; (Deuteronomy 10:4). &quot;And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
        tables in the ark which I had</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">made.&quot; (Deuteronomy 10:5).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The moral Ten Commandment law is eternal. It is
        God&#39;s own covenant, and it is as everlasting as God Himself. &quot;The law of the Lord is perfect,
        converting the soul.&quot; (Psalm 19:7). &quot;Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
        and good.&quot; (Romans 7:12). &quot;Thy law is the truth.&quot; (Psalm 119:142). &quot;Concerning Thy
        testimonies, I have known of old that Thou hast founded them</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">forever.&quot; (Psalm 119:152).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What does the law do for the sinner?</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First, it gives a knowledge of sin. &quot;By the law
        is the knowledge of sin.&quot; (Romans 3:20).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Second, it brings guilt and condemnation.
        &quot;Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every
        mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.&quot; (Romans 3:19).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third, it acts as a spiritual mirror. &quot;If any
        be a hearer of the Word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he
        beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh
        into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
        work, this man shall be blessed in his</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deed.&quot; (James 1:23-25).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Without the law the sinner is like a man afflicted
        with a deadly disease, who does not know he has it. Paul said, &quot;I had not known sin, but by the law.&quot;
        (Romans 7:7).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is the law unable to do for the sinner?</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The law of God cannot forgive or justify him; only
        Jesus can. He died to redeem us. &quot;By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His
        sight.&quot; (Romans 3:20).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The law of God cannot keep from sin
        or sanctify us. &quot;Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given
        which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.&quot; (Galatians 3:21).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The law of God cannot cleanse or keep the heart
        clean. Only Jesus can cast out the evil, and enable man to obey Him.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What does the grace of Christ do for the sinner?</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the law of God and the Spirit of God have made
        the sinner conscious of his sin, he will feel his need of Jesus Christ. Going to the Saviour, he can receive
        help. If we come to Him and confess and put away our sin, He forgives us. &quot;If we confess our sins, He is
        faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot; (1 John 1:9).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through grace, we can receive forgiveness and
        justification. &quot;Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this Man is preached unto
        you the forgiveness of sins: and by Him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not
        be justified by the law of Moses.&quot; (Acts 13:38-39).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through grace, we can be saved from sin, or
        sanctified. &quot;Thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins.&quot; (Matthew
        1:21). &quot;But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
        sanctification, and redemption.&quot; (1 Corinthians 1:30).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Grace inspires faith, and encourages us to come to
        Christ and remain with Him. &quot;By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the
        gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto
        good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.&quot; (Ephesians 2:8-10).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Grace brings us God&#39;s power. &quot;I am not
        ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the
        Jew first, and also to the Greek.&quot; (Romans 1:16).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is the relationship of a sinner, who is being
        saved by grace, to the law of God?</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The law becomes the standard of his life &quot;This
        is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.&quot; (1 John 5:3).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He permits Christ to fulfill in Him the
        righteousness of the law. (Romans 8:3). Christ writes the law on the heart. &quot;This is the covenant that I
        will make . . I will put My laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God,
        and they shall be to Me a people.&quot; (Hebrews 8:10).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is the relationship of grace, faith, love and
        the law?</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Grace is unmerited favor, but grace does not
        sanction continued transgression. &quot;What then? shall we sin,</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">because we are not under the law,
        but under grace? God forbid.&quot; (Romans 6:15).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Faith does not make void, but establishes, the law.
        &quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.&quot; (Romans 3:31).
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Faith brings overcoming power. &quot;Whatsoever is
        born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.&quot; (1
        John 5:4).</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Love is the fulfilling of the law. &quot;Love
