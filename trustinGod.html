							<h1>Your Trust in God</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/8laws/trustinGod.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Individually, you and I need the ministry of
								God&#39;s healing power in our own lives. Oh, how great is our need! Yet, thankfully, it is available.</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this concluding chapter I want to tell you about
								this healing ministry that God has for you. For it is available to you as you come to Jesus, and become His
								trustful follower, obedient to His Written Word.</h4>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are the answers that you are looking for,
								summarized from a special book, <i>The Ministry of Healing (see order sheet).</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our story starts with Jesus. He came to this world
								at His first advent, to reveal to us the love of God and not only to show us His care for us, but also how we,
								in His strength, should care for one another.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His work is to give us forgiveness of sin,
								overcoming power, health, peace, and perfection of character.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Varied were the circumstances and needs of those who
								besought His aid, and none who came to Him went away unhelped. This help—this healing—is for us today. Wherever
								there are hearts ready to receive His words—the words of Scripture,—He will bring them the comfort of His own
								presence, the assurance of their heavenly Father&#39;s love.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In all things He brought His wishes into strict
								alignment with the purpose for His life. He glorified His life by making everything in it subordinate to the
								will of His Father. His life was one of constant self- sacrifice. He spent His days ministering to the needy and
								teaching those who desired to learn how to become part of His kingdom. Always patient and cheerful, much of His
								time was given to minister to the sick and infirm. Yet He made each work of healing an opportunity to implant
								divine principles of truth in mind and soul. For it was His plan to help men and women physically, so that He
								could then minister</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to them spiritually.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At every opportunity He presented the Word—the holy
								Scriptures—to the people. Never was there such an evangelist as Christ. He was the Majesty of heaven, but He
								humbled Himself to take our nature, that He might meet men where they were.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He spoke to each one in such kindly, sympathetic,
								simple words that those words could not fail to be understood. He presented the truth in such a way that it was
								ever afterward intertwined with their most hallowed memories. His instruction was so direct, His illustrations
								so appropriate, His words so sympathetic and encouraging,—that His hearers could sense the completeness of His
								identification with their interests and happiness. What a busy life He led, as He went from home to home
								ministering to the needy and downcast. Gracious, tenderhearted, pitiful, He went about lifting up the bowed-down
								and comforting the sorrowful. Wherever He went, He brought blessing and better living.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jesus sought to reach the poor; He sought also to
								reach the rich, for they needed His help just as badly. Just now He is seeking to reach you and me and help us
								in our special needs.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Christ came to this world to show that, by receiving
								power from on high, one can live an unsullied life. With unwearying patience and sympathetic helpfulness, He met
								men in their necessities. It mattered not to Him what might be their rank or status in life, for He was not a
								policy man. That which appealed to His heart was a soul thirsting for the water of life.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;He passed by no human being as worthless, but
								sought to apply the healing remedy to every soul. In whatever company He found Himself, He presented a lesson
								appropriate to the time and the circumstances. Every neglect or insult shown by men to their fellow men, only
								made Him more conscious of their need of His divine-human sympathy.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;He sought to inspire with hope the
								roughest and most unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they might become blameless and harmless,
								attaining such a character as would make them manifest as the children of God.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Often He met those who had drifted under
								Satan&#39;s control, and who had no power to break from his snare. To such a one, discouraged, sick, tempted,
								fallen, Jesus would speak words of tenderest pity, words that were needed and could be understood. Others He met
								were fighting a hand-to-hand battle with the adversary of souls. These He encouraged to persevere, assuring them
								that they would win; for angels of God were on their side, and would give them the victory.&quot;—<i>The
									Ministry of Healing, pp. 25-26.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His sympathy, social kindliness, and concern for
								their best good,—made men and women long to become worthy of His confidence. Upon their thirsty hearts His words
								fell with blessed, life-giving power. New impulses were awakened and, though they might be outcasts of society,
								there opened before them the possibility of a new life.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The same Jesus is calling you to
								His side today. Whatever your past may have been, regardless of your weakness,—He wants to forgive your past,
								transform your weakness by His grace, through obedience to His Written Word, the Holy Scriptures.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Christ neglects no one. Wherever there are hearts
								open to receive the truth, Christ is ready to instruct them. He reveals to them the Father, and the service
								acceptable to Him.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Christ was hid in God, and God was revealed in the
								character of His Son. The evidence of His divinity was seen in His ministry to the needs of suffering humanity.
								Not by pomp and the overthrowing of kingdoms was Christ to establish His kingdom, but by speaking to the hearts
								of men by a life of mercy and self-sacrifice. His healing ministry is for you today, that His life might be
								yours. His objective is that your soul shall be imbued with the principles of heaven; so that then, as you come
								in contact with others, you will be enabled to impart of Heaven&#39;s light to them. Your consistent
								faithfulness to God and His Word will be a special means of revealing that light.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Human effort will be efficient in the work of
								God just according to the consecrated devotion of the worker,—by revealing the power of the grace of Christ to
								transform the life. We are to be distinguished from the world because God has placed His seal upon us, because
								He manifests in us His own character of love. Our Redeemer covers us with His righteousness.&quot;—<i>The
									Ministry of Healing, p. 37.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are a mother, the Master desires to help you
								in your work to raise your children for God. Come to Him, and tell Him of your needs, and He will impart
								strength and blessing, just as He did to the mothers who, so long ago, brought their little ones to Him for a
								blessing. Come to Him for help that you may be empowered to better take up your daily duties again. Instruct
								your children in the Word of God, and in after years the memory of the words of Scripture will keep many from
								straying from the pathway to heaven.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But do not let your un-Christlikeness hinder the
								little ones from coming to Jesus. Plead with God, alone in prayer, for grace and help in time of need, that you
								may provide them the example of right living that they desire to see in you.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We should neglect nothing that would serve to
								benefit a human being. Let everything be gathered up that will relieve the necessities of earth&#39;s hungry
								ones . . By every word of God we are to live. Nothing that God has spoken is to be lost. Not one word that
								concerns our eternal salvation are we to neglect . . The miracle of the loaves teaches dependence upon God. When
								Christ fed the five thousand, the food was not nigh at hand . . The providence of God had placed Jesus where He
								was, and He depended on His heavenly Father for means to relieve the necessity. When we are brought into strait
								places, we are to depend on God. In every emergency we are to seek help from Him who has infinite resources at
								His command.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, pp. 48-49.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Saviour&#39;s life on earth
								was a life of communion with nature and with God. In this communion He revealed for us the secret of a life of
								power. In study of the Inspired Word, earnest prayer, and careful obedience, the soul is ennobled and enabled to
								fulfill its mission in life.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All day Christ ministered to the people, but in the
								evening or at dawn He spent hours in prayer to His heavenly Father. Returning from the time spent in prayer, a
								look of peace, freshness, and power seemed to pervade His whole being. From hours spent alone with God, He came
								forth morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. And as He opened to men the treasures of truth,
								they were vitalized by divine power and inspired by hope and courage. Out of the depths of His pure,
								compassionate heart, the good Shepherd had only love and pity for these restless, thirsting souls.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Take time as Jesus did to be alone with God, that
								you also may be strengthened in your own battles with temptation, enabled to live a godly life, and minister to
								the needs of those around you.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;All who are under the training of God need
								the quiet hour for communion with their own hearts, with nature, and with God. In them is to be revealed a life
								that is not in harmony with the world, its customs, or its practices; and they need to have a personal
								experience in obtaining a knowledge of the will of God.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;We must individually hear Him speaking to
								the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes
								more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, `Be still, and know that I am God.&#39; <i>(Psalm 46:10).</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;This is the effectual preparation for all
								labor for God. Amidst the hurrying throng, and the strain of life&#39;s intense activities, he who is thus
								refreshed, will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. He will receive a new endowment of both
								physical and mental strength. His life will breathe out a fragrance, and will reveal a divine power that will
								reach men&#39;s hearts.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, p. 58.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If I may but touch His garment, I shall be
								whole&quot; (Matthew 9:21), said the woman, and by her persistent faith she was healed. Christ realized her
								great need, and He was helping her to exercise faith. As He passed, she reached forward and succeeded in barely
								touching the border of His garment. That moment she knew she was healed. It is through contact with Christ that
								we are strengthened and helped. To believe in Christ merely as the Saviour of the world can never bring healing
								to the soul. The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere assenting to the truth of the gospel. True faith
								means that we receive Christ as our personal Saviour from sin.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith
								is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation with God. A living
								faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which, through the grace of Christ, the soul becomes a
								conquering power.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, p. 62.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is help for those with evil
								habits that grip them. That help is to be found in Christ. He can break the chains, transform the mind, and
								remake us into the image of God. Turn the eye not to the dark cave of despair,—but upward to Christ. Fix the eye
								upon Jesus, and the glory of His unchanging power will do for you that which you could never do for yourself.
								The centurion came to Christ for help, not fearing to ask Him for help. Not to his own goodness did he trust,
								but to the Saviour&#39;s mercy. His only argument was his great need. So it is with us. In the same way we may
								come to Him.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Remember that Christ came into the world to
								save sinners. We have nothing to recommend us to God; the plea that we may urge now and ever is our utterly
								helpless condition which makes His redeeming power a necessity. Renouncing all self- dependence, we may look to
								the cross of Calvary and say: <i>`In my hand no price I bring; simply to Thy cross I cling.&#39;</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot; `If thou canst believe, all things are
								possible to him that believeth.&#39; (Mark 9:23). It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us
								strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ, God has provided means for subduing every evil
								trait, and resisting every temptation, however strong.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, pp. 65-66.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But so many feel that they must first make
								themselves &quot;right&quot; before they can come to Christ. Yet only Jesus can forgive our past and give us
								strength to overcome in the future. Coming to Him we receive this help; staying with Him continues this help.
								Look not to self, but to Christ. In your helplessness, cast yourself upon Him. He will receive you and never,
								except by your own choice, let you go. As you come, believe that He accepts you—simply because He has promised.
								You can never perish while you do this, never!</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to
								our prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something other than we ask; but not so when we ask for
								deliverance from sin. Thank God that that is so. It is His will to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children,
								and to enable us to live a holy life.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Looking upon the distressed and heart-burdened,
								those whose hopes have been blighted, Jesus calls them to Himself. He sees their wasted years of seeking to
								quiet the longings of the soul by the trinkets and tinsel of worldliness and sin,—and He invites them to come
								unto Him for the peace of heart that they so much want, genuine peace of heart that they can find nowhere else.
							</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He is speaking to you just now: &quot;Take My
								yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&quot;
								(Matthew 11:29). All are weary and heavy laden with the cares of life. Come, He bids you; come. Only Christ can
								remove the burdens. And the heaviest load that we bear is the burden of sin.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He knows all the weaknesses of humanity, all of
								our wants, all of our temptations.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;He is watching over you, trembling child of
								God. Are you tempted? He will deliver. Are</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you weak? He will strengthen. Are
								you ignorant? He will enlighten. Are you wounded? He will heal. The Lord `telleth the number of the stars;&#39;
								and yet `He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.&quot; <i>(Psalm 147: 3, 4).</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Whatever your anxieties and trials, spread
								out your case before the Lord. Your spirit will be braced for endurance. The way will be open for you to
								disentangle yourself from embarrassment and difficulty. The weaker and more helpless you know yourself to be,
								the stronger will you become in His strength. The heavier your burdens, the more blessed the rest in casting
								them upon your Burden bearer.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Circumstances may separate friends; the
								restless waters of the wide sea may roll between us and them. But no circumstances, no distance, can separate us
								from the Saviour.</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wherever we may be, He is at our right hand, to
								support, maintain, uphold, and cheer. Greater than the love of a mother for her child is Christ&#39;s love, for
								His redeemed. It is our privilege to rest in His love, to say, `I will trust Him; for He gave His life for
								me.&#39; &quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, pp. 71-72.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As with those that He healed while on earth, Christ
								watches the first glimmer of faith grow stronger as we are aroused to seek Him. It is Jesus who is convicting
								your heart, and drawing you to Himself right now. If it were not for the inexpressible love of God and the
								drawing of His Holy Spirit, none of us could come to Him. Our problems, our sicknesses, are often the result of
								our own habits. Yet He does not turn us away. He bids us come that He may solve our problems in His own unique
								way. The solutions may not come in exactly the manner we expected. Sometimes instead of removing the problem, He
								gives us strength to live with it. In Him we have victory and peace, whatever the circumstances of life around
								us.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe
								the Saviour&#39;s word. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting upon His word you
								will receive strength to obey His Moral Ten Commandment Law. Whatever may be the evil practice, the master
								passion which may bind both soul and body, Christ is able to deliver.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;When temptations assail you, when care and
								perplexity surround you, when, depressed and discouraged, you are ready to yield to despair, look to Jesus, and
								the darkness that encompasses you will be dispelled by the bright shining of His presence.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;When sin struggles for the mastery in your
								soul, and burdens the conscience, look to the Saviour. His grace is sufficient to subdue sin.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Let your grateful heart, trembling with
								uncertainty, turn to Him. Lay hold on the hope set before you. Christ waits to adopt you into His family. His
								strength will help your weakness; He will lead you step by step. Place your hand in His, and let Him guide you.
							</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Never feel that Christ is
								far away. He is always near. His loving presence surrounds you. Seek Him as One who desires to be found of you.
								He desires you not only to touch His garments, but to walk with Him in constant communion.&quot;—<i>The Ministry
									of Healing, p.</i></p>
							<p class="s11" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">85.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The soul that turns to Him for refuge, Christ lifts
								above the accusing and strife of tongues. No man or evil angel can impeach that soul. Christ will unite you to
								His own divine-human nature, and by faith you will stand beside your Saviour in heavenly places, in the light

							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result of the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary,
								we are henceforth to look on Satan as a conquered foe. Clinging to Christ we are safe, moment by moment.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And now, having found the ark of safety yourself,

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The two restored demoniacs were the first
								missionaries whom Christ sent to teach the gospel in the region of Decapolis. For a short time only, these men
								had listened to His words. Not one sermon from His lips had ever fallen upon their ears. They could not instruct
								the people as the disciples who had been daily with Christ were able to do.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But they could tell what they knew; what they
								themselves had seen, and heard, and felt of the Saviour&#39;s power. This is what everyone can do whose heart
								has been touched by the grace of God. This is the witness for which our Lord calls, and for want of which the
								world is perishing.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, p. 99.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Christ sends the very ones who have been freed from
								Satan&#39;s prison camp—to tell the prisoners who remain behind of the good news. Our confession of what Christ
								has done for us is Heaven&#39;s chosen plan for revealing Him to the world. And everyone has his own unique way
								of telling that message. Begin sharing it now, for others are waiting to hear it. And as you do so, your own
								experience will deepen.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Every true disciple is born into the kingdom
								of God as a missionary. No sooner does he come to know the Saviour than he desires to make others acquainted
								with Him. The saving and sanctifying truth can not be shut up in his heart. He who drinks of the water of life
								becomes a fountain of life. The receiver becomes a giver . . In doing this work a greater blessing is received
								than if we work merely to benefit ourselves. It is in working to spread the good news of salvation that we are
								brought near to the Saviour.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, pp. 102-103.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In sympathy and compassion we are to minister to
								those in need of help, seeking with unselfish earnestness to lighten the woes of suffering humanity. We are not
								to think ourselves detached from the perishing world around us. They are part of the web of humanity; a web that
								we ourselves are part of.</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Millions of human beings, in sickness and ignorance
								and sin, have never so much as heard of Christ&#39;s</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">love for them. Were our condition
								and theirs to be reversed, what would we desire them to do for us? As far as lies in our power, we must help
								them. Whatever our talents or abilities, we are, by those abilities, in debt to all less fortunate than
								ourselves. Our strength must be used to help them in their weakness.</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Jesus did not consider heaven a place to be
								desired while we were lost. He left the heavenly courts for a life of reproach and insult, and a death of shame.
								He who was rich in heaven&#39;s priceless treasure became poor, that through His poverty we might be rich. We
								are to follow in the path that He trod.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, p. 105.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The strongest evidence of man&#39;s fall from a
								higher state is the fact that it costs so much to return. The pathway of this return can be trod only by hard
								fighting, inch by inch, hour by hour. One hasty, unguarded act can bring us deep trouble. We dare not act from
								impulse. Beset with temptations without number, we must resist in the strength of Christ. Live by principle and
								obedience to the Word of God.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The life of the apostle Paul was a constant
								conflict with self. He said, `I die daily&#39; . . His will and his desires every day conflicted with duty and
								the will of God. Instead of following inclination, he did God&#39;s will, however crucifying to his
								nature.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, pp. 452-453.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is only by unceasing endeavor that we can
								maintain the victory over the temptations of Satan. But God will give the strength for this as you cry to Him
								for help, determining that you will not leave His side.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Only by overcoming as Christ overcame shall we
								win the crown of life. But we must realize our great need of His help in order to receive it. It is only as we
								see our utter helplessness and renounce all self- trust, that we can lay hold on divine power.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;It is not only at the beginning of the
								Christian life that this renunciation of self is to be made. At every advance step heavenward it is to be
								renewed. All our good works are dependent on a power outside of ourselves; therefore there needs to be a
								continual reaching out of the heart after God, a constant, earnest confession of sin and humbling of the soul
								before Him. Perils surround us; and we are safe only as we feel our weakness and cling with the grasp of faith
								to our mighty Deliverer.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, pp. 455- 456.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is faith in Christ and the study of the Inspired
								Word of God that can bring us this power. The entire Bible is a revelation of what God is like. Within its pages
								we find the needed strength, and the key to unlock it is earnest, humble, dependent, obedient trust in God. It
								is obedience that makes the difference.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The truths of the Bible, received, will
								uplift mind and soul. If the Word of God were appreciated as it should be, both young and old would possess an
								inward rectitude, a strength of principle, that would enable them to resist temptation.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of
									Healing, p. 459.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apart from the Sacred Scriptures,
								man&#39;s greatest philosophies are only conjectures. It is not men&#39;s writings, but the Bible that you need.
								Let the life, ministry, and death of Christ become your study. And teach Bible principles to your children as
								well.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The knowledge of God as revealed in His Word
								is the knowledge to be given to our children. From the earliest dawn of reason they should be made familiar with
								the name and life of Jesus. Their first lessons should teach them that God is their Father. Their first training
								should be that of loving obedience. Reverently and tenderly let the Word of God be read and repeated to them, in
								portions suited to their comprehension and adapted to awaken their interest. And, above all, let them learn of
								His love revealed in Christ, and its great lesson: `If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.&#39;
								(1 John 4:11).&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, p. 460.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Such a humble, prayerful study of the Word of God
								can bring the character-changing power of the Holy Spirit into your life. You come to know God by an
								experimental knowledge, and prove, for yourself, the reality of His Word and the truth of His Scriptures. You
								are tasting and seeing that the Lord is good.</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You are setting your seal to the fact that God is
								true. (Psalm 34:8; John 3:33). This may be your experience:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;He can bear witness to that which he himself
								has seen and heard and felt of the power of Christ. He can testify:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot; `I needed help, and I found it in Jesus.
								Every want was supplied, the hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the revelation of Christ. I
								believe in Jesus because He is to me a divine Saviour. I believe the Bible because I have found it to be the
								voice of God to my soul.&#39; &quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, p. 461.</i></p>

							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is our privilege to reach higher and still
								higher, for clearer revelations of the character of God. In His light we shall see light, until mind and heart
								and soul are transformed into the image of His holiness. As we walk in the path of humble obedience, fulfilling
								His purpose, we will learn more and more of the deep things of His Word.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Take the Bible as your guide, and stand firm for
								principle,—and you may attain the highest level of usefulness as a servant of the living God. And this is what
								your want for your life now? As you dwell upon His goodness, His mercy, and His love, clearer and still clearer
								will be your perceptions of truth. The soul dwelling in the pure atmosphere of holy thought is transformed by
								such continuous contact with God through the study of His word. Self is lost sight of, and we become more and
								more like the One whom we have come so much to love.</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The relation that exists between the mind and

							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">greater degree than many realize.
								Many of the diseases from which men suffer are the result of mental depression. Grief, anxiety, discontent,

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Disease is sometimes produced, and is often

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;There is, however, a form of mind-cure that
								is one of the most effective agencies for evil. Through this so-called science, one mind is brought under the
								control of another, so that the individuality of the weaker is merged in that of the stronger mind. One person
								acts out the will of another. Thus is claimed that the tenor of the thought may be changed, that health-giving
								impulses may be imparted.&quot;—<i>The Ministry of Healing, p. 242.</i></p>

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;The power of the will is not valued as it
								should be. Let the will be kept awake and rightly directed, and it will impart energy to the whole being, and
								will be a wonderful aid in the maintenance of health. It is a power also in dealing with disease. Exercised in

							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Nothing tends more to promote health of body

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Abiding peace, true rest of spirit, has but

								and I will give you rest.&#39; (Matthew 11:28). `Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the
								world giveth, give I unto you.&#39; (John 14:27). This peace is not something that He gives apart from Himself.
								It is in Christ, and we can receive it only by receiving Him . . When the sunlight of God&#39;s love illuminates

									<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This unwavering warning has been given from

							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Voice from heaven, saying, Come

							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Out of confusion, false doctrines, and worldliness,
								God is calling His people. Thousands of them are coming from every part of the world. They come because God is
								calling them, and His &quot;sheep hear His voice.&quot; They separate from the ways of the world (1 John 2:15-
								17), lay aside its pride and vanity (1 Timothy 2:9-10; 1 Peter 3:3-4), give up its evil ways (2 Corinthians
								7:1), and turn to Jesus for salvation. Then, by His grace, they &quot;keep the commandments of God, and the
								faith of Jesus.&quot; (Revelation 14:12). The true church, therefore, as you can see, must come out and be
								separate.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He keeps &quot;the commandments of God,&quot; (2)
								&quot;the faith of Jesus,&quot; and who (3) &quot;have the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot; He observes the
								Bible Sabbath, the Seventh-day Sabbath.</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is God&#39;s true church, according to the
								prophecies of the Bible, but the majority of His true followers, still in the churches of Babylon, are living
								according to all the truth they have. Will you yourself not answer the call, &quot;Come out of her, My
								people,&quot; make your own decision, and by your example help to gather others into the fold of Christ?</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh, my friend, every day we need a daily victory in
								Christ! Here is more information on how to experience it:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s14" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DAILY VICTORY IN CHRIST</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jesus said, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the
								life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.&quot; (John 14:6). And the apostle John wrote, &quot;He that
								hath the Son hath life.&quot; (1 John 5:12). Paul wrote, &quot;For to me to live is Christ.&quot; (Philippians
								1:21). &quot;Nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&quot; (Galatians 2:20). &quot;l can do all
								things through Christ which strengtheneth me.&quot; (Philippians 4:13).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The active exercise of living faith in Christ is the
								one great essential to obtaining and maintaining an experience in the Lord that will bring increasing
								satisfaction in this life and ultimate deliverance from this world when Christ comes. &quot;Without faith it is
								impossible to please Him.&quot; (Hebrews 11:6). &quot;This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
								faith.&quot; (1 John 5:4). &quot;God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.&quot; (Romans 12:3). Faith is
								a gift of God to every man—rich and poor, high and low, free and bond, wise and simple. It is man&#39;s duty to
								nourish and exercise this faith. Though it be as small as a grain of mustard seed, it can grow and be used to
								move mountains of evil and build temples of righteousness.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, it is not merely faith, but primarily the
								object of true faith that counts most. Faith in God, in Christ, in the promises of the Holy Scriptures, and in
								all God&#39;s plans and agencies for the accomplishment of His purposes is what we need. It is what we must have
								if we are to be victorious. Let us now see how faith makes us righteous and holy in God&#39;s sight.</p>
							<p class="s14" style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HOW MAY A SINNER BECOME
								RIGHTEOUS?</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Being justified [forgiven and made righteous]
								by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;—<i>Romans 5:1.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Be it known unto you therefore, men and
								brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by Him all that believe are
								justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.&quot;—<i>Acts 13:38-39.</i>
							</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you will read the story of the Pharisee and the
								publican in Luke 18:9-14, you will note that the publican sought forgiveness of sin. &quot;God be merciful to me
								a sinner,&quot; he cried. Jesus adds this comment, &quot;I tell you, this man went down to his house
								justified.&quot; In other words, the &quot;forgiveness&quot; that the publican sought, Jesus called
								&quot;justification.&quot; This includes also the merciful gift of righteousness, which God counts to the credit
								of the repentant sinner for the simple reason that he has no acceptable righteousness of his own! The great
								store of righteousness upon which God draws, when imputing (counting) this undeserved credit, is the righteous
								life of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A man may have been unjust, but by faith he may be
								counted as just. When an unjust man is thus accounted as a just man, he is &quot;justified.&quot; He is forgiven
								all past sins. God gives him credit as a righteous person (through Christ). Then he has peace. He is counted as
								though he had never sinned at all.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This justification comes by faith in the blood of a
								righteous Christ.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Being justified freely by His grace through
								the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood,
								to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
								God.&quot;—<i>Romans 3:24-25</i>.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
								just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;—<i>1 John 1:9.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The cleansing from unrighteousness is through the
								blood of Christ. The sinner is condemned to eternal death for the violation of God&#39;s eternal law. The
								substitute death of another sinner would not atone. No angel of glory could die to save man. Since the divine
								law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could make atonement for its transgression.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So Jesus came, lived a sinless life and &quot;died
								for our sins according to the Scriptures&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:3), and it is He &quot;whom God hath set forth
								to be a propitiation [satisfaction] through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission
								of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.&quot; (Romans 3:25). Thus do we exercise faith in the
								blood of a righteous Christ whose righteous life answers for our unrighteous and unjust past. &quot;To declare,
								I say, at this time, His righteousness: that He</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -40pt;line-height: 222%;text-align: left;">[God] might be
								just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.&quot; (Romans 3:26). &quot;Him that cometh to Me I will
								in no wise cast out.&quot;—<i>John 6:37.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any man, who will, may come to Christ. Whosoever
								will, may come. And no sincere seeker will be turned away.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are
								heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&quot;—<i>Matthew 11:28.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At conversion, Christ satisfies the claims of the
								sacred, unchangeable law by counting His righteousness to the sinner&#39;s credit. The gracious gift of
								forgiveness God offers free. It is ours to exercise faith to the point of taking the gift. &quot;Lay hold on
								eternal life.&quot; (1 Timothy 6:12). This is a definite spiritual action and transaction. We give God our sins
								and He gives us forgiveness. It is by faith that the just shall live. (Romans 1:17).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Do we then make void the law through
								faith?&quot; This is a very good question. Paul answers, &quot;God forbid: yea, we establish the law.&quot;
								(Romans 3:31). We are forgiven that we might from henceforth be obedient children, walking in all the
								commandments of the Lord blameless. This life of victory begins by faith in Christ&#39;s righteousness. It
								continues by faith in Christ&#39;s righteousness. It ends by faith in Christ&#39;s righteousness. It is
								Christ—Christ—Christ—first, last, and always. He alone is the Saviour—in the beginning, through life, and at
								death. And faith in Him is the connecting link.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s14" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WHAT NEW RELATIONSHIP DOES THE CHRISTIAN
								ENJOY?</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Without reservation the follower of Christ will say
								to Christ, as Thomas did, &quot;My Lord and my</p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">God.&quot; (John 20:28). Jesus has a perfect right
								thus to be honored. He said, &quot;Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.&quot; (John 13:13).
								As our Lord and Master, Jesus bids us follow Him.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;He saith unto them, Follow Me . . And they
								straightway . . followed Him.&quot;—<i>Matthew 4:19-20.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
								that he hath, he cannot be My disciple.&quot;—<i>Luke 14:33.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Too many hear the good news of escape from hell and
								of a way to heaven, and &quot;with joy&quot; receive it. They want to escape trial and suffering; they have
								visions of beautiful mansions on high that they will occupy by and by. But they are not concerned with relating
								themselves to Christ as followers and disciples. They are not prepared to acknowledge Jesus as &quot;my Lord and
								my God.&quot; Jesus gave up heaven, came down here, and risked eternal loss that we might gain heaven. He who
								would accept this sacrifice intelligently and wholeheartedly will give up this world in order to follow the
								Saviour (see Philippians 2:5). This means sacrifice. But think—think of the promise:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Every one that hath forsaken
								houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My name&#39;s sake,
								shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.&quot;— <i>Matthew 19:29.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For all that we give up, God will return a
								hundredfold. He takes away, but only to give more and better in return.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Whosoever heareth these sayings of Mine, and
								doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the
								floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a
								rock.&quot;—<i>Matthew 7:24-25.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we hear and obey, we shall be built upon the
								solid rock, Christ Jesus, not otherwise. Between these two extremes lie all the shades and colors of professed
								Christianity.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s14" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WHAT IS THE SECRET OF SPIRITUAL POWER?
							</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the transaction has been made in which faith
								claims forgiveness for past sins, and after the soul by faith makes a complete surrender of all to Christ as
								Lord and Saviour, to do God&#39;s will and obey all His commandments, the next step is to have faith in Christ
								as a living Saviour with power to deliver you; yes, and to keep you from the power of sin. To learn this is to
								discover the secret of spiritual power. It is not enough to believe in the death of Christ. It is not enough to
								surrender to Christ. We must believe that Christ is a risen, all-powerful Saviour, who can and will bring
								victory over sin into the life through His indwelling Spirit. All of this is made possible through His
								resurrection victory. Paul said, &quot;That 1 may know Him, and the power of His resurrection.&quot;
								(Philippians 3:10). Here are three promises of power made by the risen Saviour.</p>

							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This power, as in the case of all other blessings,
								comes through active faith. &quot;This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.&quot; (1 John
								5:4). &quot;A living faith means a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power.&quot; And by
								all means, hold on! &quot;Being confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a good work in you will
								perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.&quot; (Philippians 1:6). In this way, dear friend, we enter upon the
								life of victory. In this way, we receive spiritual power for an abiding life of conquest in the Saviour!</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p class="s14" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HOW DOES THE BIBLE HELP OUR FAITH?</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is yet something important we must mention to
								help you. Faith, to be strong, must be fed. The Word of God is the food of faith. The Bible is heaven&#39;s
								pantry, on the shelves of which are stored, in unlimited quantity and almost infinite variety, the foods that
								nourish Christian faith and experience, and abundant delicacies to delight the soul of the Christian (see
								Jeremiah 15:16). &quot;Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.&quot; (Psalm 19:10).</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it is so easy to keep on trying to live while
								neglecting to feed upon this heavenly food. Often the cares and pleasures of this life consume our time and
								energies to the neglect of God&#39;s Word. Sometimes, even in the work of God, it is possible to grow nervous
								and anxious, to work in haste, if not in fury, to do God&#39;s service, while at the same time neglecting to
								nourish the soul and the spirit with daily, regular feeding on God&#39;s Word. The importance of daily Bible
								reading may be seen by the following:</p>

								&quot;It is written.&quot; (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10). &quot;Then the devil leaveth Him, and, behold, angels came and
								ministered unto Him.&quot; (Matthew 4:11). Oh friend, know this Book. Know it well. Use it in temptation to
								conquer the world and sin. Use it when overwhelmed with sorrow and fear and worry. Use it when doubt and
								unbelief assail you. Every promise has power; every command, wisdom; every warning, deep meaning. Become known
								as a Bible-believing, Bible-practicing Christian.</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Ask, and it shall be given you,&quot; said
								Jesus. &quot;Every one that asketh receiveth.&quot; (Matthew 7:7-8). So it is clear that God has made prayer the

							<p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Christian service is necessary for soul prosperity.
								&quot;Take my yoke upon you,&quot; said Jesus. (Matthew 11:29). All life is action. We cannot be ever receiving
								and never giving. By faith we receive forgiveness and appropriate power. We feed on the Word of God and pray for
								this and that, but we must surrender, not only to do the will of God as between ourselves and Him, but to do His
								will toward others.</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every soul is born into God&#39;s kingdom as a
								missionary. Every Christian should be a soul winner. Moody said that if a man will read the Word of God fifteen
								minutes a day, pray sincerely fifteen minutes a day, and spend fifteen minutes a day talking definitely to help
								some soul to Christ, or heavenward, he will enjoy a good experience. Not only the ministers but the laymen
								should work to make others Christians. Think about the following texts:</p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I. &quot;Go ye into all the world,
								and preach the gospel.&quot;—<i>Mark 16:15.</i></p>
							<p style="padding-top: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"></p>
							<p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">God needs you to help spread abroad the story of the
								saving gospel and the speedy return of Jesus. If you love Him, the saving truth cannot be sealed up in your
								heart. It will overflow in blessing to others.</p>
